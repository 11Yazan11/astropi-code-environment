# Maybe for accelerometer data to compute the orbit since we know the path
# I don't think so, the acceleration of the Astro-Pi is none (general relativity physics).
# The Earth is going up towards the Iss, but the Iss keeps rotating so it never falls, but there is no net acceleration.
# It just follows some geodesic stuff I guess.

# Gotta try it in the online simulator after doing the code.
